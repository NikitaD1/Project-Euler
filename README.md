## Project Euler Solutions 

Welcome to my personal collection of solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems â€” a journey through mathematical reasoning, algorithm design, and elegant Python code.

## âœ¨ About This Repo

This repository contains clean, well-commented Python solutions to selected Project Euler problems, starting from Problem 1. The aim is not just to solve the problem but to do so **efficiently and readably**.

---

## ðŸ›  Structure

Each problem has:
- A Python script named `XXX.py` where `XX` is the problem number
- A docstring or comment block at the top with the problem description
- A `compute()` function that contains the core logic
- A performance timer (when relevant)
- Explanations or optimizations if applicable
